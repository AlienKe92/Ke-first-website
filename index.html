<h1> What K-Way's about? </h1>


<P> At K-Way, we aim to raise awareness, persistence and funding to protect our world from being completely irreversible. 
<p>
    We want to give the newer generations a fighting chance to make something of themselves! We want that chance ourselves.<br>
    <br>
    but we really cannot lead into a future if old operations continue to daily run. without consequences being thought of properly.

     <p> A picture can speak for itself, but take this picture of one tree being cut down,
         <br>
         <br> And multiply it to between 3.5 to 7 billion times. That is a lot of trees. Even healthy trees are caught up in it! <br>
         <br>
         Being destroyed for human demands0 There has to be something that could minimize the amount of mass deforestation. </p>
