<h1> Welcome to The Home of K-Way </h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p> <p>
    Have you ever driven past a house, or a row of houses that are the size of offices, <br>
    to only find that 1, maybe 2 people live in it?<br>
    Are you the kind of person that gets quite annoyed or irritated at this? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Do you get sick and tired of people not disposing of rubbish and recycling correctly? 
    <br>
    <br>
    Or how about humans consuming, devouring and ignoring the signs of our earth and the devastating disasters she is creating.
    <br>
    Not because she feels like it, but because we are altering the earths scientific factors everyday, making more pollution, producing more than humans genuinely need.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    So K=Way is where I wanted to step in and learn to code/create and share these views. I am the creator iof K-Way and my name is K
